# Skin-Classification-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow
Building a deep learning model that classifies skin images with samples of 8 common skin pathologies and carcinoma.

There are three parts:

1. Classify the diseases using best deep learning architecture for classification
2. Use transfer learning on ResNet, GoogleNet to retrain some part of the network
3. Use a generative adversarial network(GAN) to generate new images for these diseases
