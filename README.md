# Skin-Classification-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow
Building a deep learning model that classifies skin images with samples of 8 common skin pathologies and carcinoma.

There are three parts:

1. Classifying the diseases using a deep learning model.
2. Using transfer learning on ResNet, GoogleNet to retrain some part of the network.
3. Using a generative adversarial network(GAN) to generate new images for the diseases.
